### ⚙️ GitHub Pages to Vercel: What Happened

I’ve been using GitHub Pages for a while now. I think my first ever website was in **Flutter**, and I really wanted to deploy it on GitHub Pages because I kept seeing people flexing those `github.io` links - and yeah, it looked cool to me at the time.

Anyway, I had *no* idea how to deploy websites back then - I’m talking early third year of college - and no ChatGPT to help out (sounding like boomers saying *"we didn’t have internet back in our day"*, but honestly it’s valid).

I was scrolling Twitter and following a bunch of people from the Flutter world. One of them was **Aditya Thakur**, a fellow SRMite, who posted a video on how to host your website. That video led to my first ever hosted site - which was also *the* first website I ever made, since I was deep into Flutter app dev at the time.

Fast forward to now (or like 5–6 months ago), I got into **React**. Not because I love it - more because the industry kinda forces you to. My 💙 will always be with Flutter. So I made a React-based portfolio and hosted it on GitHub Pages. Obviously.

What I didn’t realize at the time was: **GitHub Pages is for static sites**. And I didn’t really grasp what that meant.

> 💡 **Protip**: Just because something works doesn’t mean it’s the *right* tool.

A few months (or maybe days) later, I started working on **Career Fair Tracker** — you give it a job listing or scan a QR code, and it scrapes the site, makes a call to Gemini, and pulls key info like company name, role, and deadline.

Even then I didn’t realize GitHub Pages had limitations, because the app was basically using one URL and rendering content conditionally. I should say it was supporting routing, but not in the real sense.

Then came **StrandsChat** — and that’s when I started struggling. That’s when I finally understood:
→ *"Oh, GitHub Pages isn’t enough."*

Till this point, I had this dumb bias that **Vercel** was “too easy”  like it was for people who couldn’t figure out GitHub Pages.

Yeah... stupid, I know.
So I kept "vibe-coding" everything out and started hitting walls.

### 🚧 Can’t Route Properly

So I was able to set up basic routing, but then came the *cursed refresh*. Suddenly I’d start getting **404 errors** and GitHub’s “Page Not Found” message.

To fix it, I went to my trusted code buddy **ChatGPT**  and it handed me a quick fix: a `404.html` file with some redirect logic. Like a true **vibe coder**, I pasted that thing in without thinking too hard - and hey, it *worked*. At first.

But here’s the problem: with **StrandsChat** (or any LLM-based chat app), you kinda *need* dynamic routes - like `/chat/52` or `/chat/89`, one for each session. And yeah, I was generating those URLs fine. I could *visit* them too. But the moment I hit **refresh**, the whole thing broke apart again.

ChatGPT then told me to switch to **HashRouter** instead of **BrowserRouter**. Again, in true vibe-coding fashion, I pasted the new code.

😂 And funny enough... it worked.

#### 🌐 Custom Domains

**Strands** was supposed to be a weekend project.
I mean *how hard could it be to build a chat app?*
Yeah... **hell no.**

As I started building, I realized there’s *so much more* to a chat application.
It’s not just API calls to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (only thing I could afford).
It’s about creating a **beautiful UI** with **deep logic**.

And like I’m not even *training an LLM* here, but just building the app made me realize how much control I actually have over the **context window**. I had been taking LLM apps for granted - assuming it’s just a Google login with some decent UI. But nope.

Even the UI isn’t easy. It needs to be **responsive**.
Okay, throw in some `@media queries`.
Cool but then your markdown-based code blocks start **breaking layout**.

And Strands' idea was like *Slack-style threads* which doesn’t really work well when the layout explodes every time you squeeze the screen. So yeah, just `@media query` is not enough.

And **UI is just the beginning**.

Let’s talk **security**:
- It's not just about throwing a few Firebase JSON configs.
- You need **auth tokens** - because putting an API behind a login isn’t enough.
- If someone knows your API endpoint, they can just **hit it from Postman**.
- You. Need. **TOKENS.**

And the **real challenge**?
Not the auth. Not the markdown styling.
It’s handling **context separation**. That’s the whole point.

So... I went full unhinged dev mode.
Bought a domain. Locked in.
(That’s why you don’t leave a dev alone at 2 AM.)

Buying the domain was easy.
Routing it from GitHub Pages to `strandschat.com`? **Not so much.**

GitHub *does* have a custom domain setting.
Did that work? **Obviously not.**
The whole site was duct-taped together with `404.html` tricks and `HashRouter` hacks.

It was 4 AM, I had a **Celsius drink** down, my **AWS account open**, a **custom domain** I didn’t know how to use, and a growing obsession.
I couldn't sleep until I figured it out.

After like **6–7 prompts**, I got there:
- Change `homepage` in `package.json`
- Add a file called `CNAME` (whatever that was)

And the funny part?
Up to this point I was like:
> "*Yeah, this is probably what everyone does, right?*"


### 🚪 Vercel Enters the Picture

So one random day I had this thought:
> "I need a blogging website."
 (as if **Hashnode** wasn’t enough 🙄)

But this one had to be *personal* - just me, by me, for me.
**Rite of passage.**

And of course, I decided to build it in **Next.js**
(I’m a **tech stack collector** - because clearly React and Angular weren't enough.)

I kept going back and forth on the architecture, and finally said:
> “Screw it, let’s try **Vercel**.”

Not because of some deep reasoning - just **vibe-decision engineering** at its best.

The *idea* was that every future website I build would link to this blog:
- via `iframe` or something like that
- with posts about that specific project
- and running changelogs

> *Why Vercel though?*
Just wanted to try it out.
Nothing to do with the actual idea.

---

So I boot up **Cursor** (co-pilot of chaos), and go:
> _“make me a website that looks kind of old!”_

And what do I get?
**Absolute garbage.**

- CSS scattered like confetti
- Routing going rogue
- UI looking like it came straight out of 2005 in a bad way

So I ditch Cursor's Frankenstein code, and go:
> “You know what? Let’s just integrate the blog into the existing portfolio.”
At least that code made **some sense**.

I build it out - everything seems fine.
I run the sacred command:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Website loads. Everything seems to be working.
Then I hit **refresh**...

💥 **Boom. Website in pieces.**

- The route `/blogs/:id` is working
- The content is even rendering
- But the **buttons are gone**
- The **back link is missing**
- The layout is broken

And here I am again - sitting with a custom domain, broken routes, broken dreams.

My programming buddy (ChatGPT MVP) goes:
> “Bro, just use **VERCEL**.”

But I resist. I cling to **HashRouter** like it’s my only salvation.

It *almost* works.

Refresh works.
Hash-based routing works.
Then I remove the `#` from the URL...

💣 **BOOM.**

- CSS gone
- Buttons missing
- Layout busted again

And that’s when I finally **gave in**.

### ⚙️ Configuring Vercel

It felt kind of overwhelming at first.

I had a **running website** on GitHub Pages, and now I was about to stop that and shift completely to **Vercel**.

First question that hit me:
> “Can I have it on **both** GitHub Pages and Vercel?”
Just in case some recruiter clicks the old `github.io` link I sent out weeks ago?

But then I was like
> “If they *really* want to reach me, they’ll find a way.”

So I **rolled the dice**.

---

Here’s what I did to migrate from GitHub Pages to Vercel:

✅ **Removed all the GitHub-specific config**:
- `404.html`
- `CNAME` file
- The `homepage` field in `package.json`

✅ **Connected the repo to Vercel**, and literally - the **moment** I pushed code, it was **LIVE** on the Vercel dashboard.

---

And here’s the only config that actually mattered:

> 📁 Root Folder: `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

> 📁 Public Folder: `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

---

🔗 For the **custom domain**, it was just a matter of:
- Copying a few DNS configs from Vercel
- Pasting them into **Namecheap**
- And... 💥 done!

---

Now I can share **direct blog post links** without worrying about reload issues, routing hacks, or half-loaded pages.

And unlike GitHub Pages, **Vercel deploys in seconds.**
No ceremony. No 10-minute delays.
Just push → live.


#### 🧩 One Last Issue to be Addressed

I just wanted to make sure **anyone with the old GitHub Pages link** could still reach my new site on **shresth.work**.

But there was a problem:
> I **couldn't keep both** GitHub Pages and Vercel running on the same custom domain - because when GitHub Pages was active, **Vercel wouldn’t work** properly on `shresth.work`.

---

So I applied a **little hack** 🧠:

- Went to the `gh-pages` branch
- Ran `rm -rf` to clear it all
- Dropped this simple redirect snippet into `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://shresth.work" />
    <title>Redirecting…</title>
    <script>
      window.location.replace("https://shresth.work");
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>If you are not redirected, <a href="https://shresth.work">click here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now anyone hitting the old `github.io/portfolio` link gets **instantly rerouted** to my shiny new site.

Mission complete. and all it took was my sanity for like 3-4 hours and some ☕.
