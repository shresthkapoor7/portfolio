## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.

## Basic Hooks

### useState Hook

The `useState` hook is the most fundamental hook that allows you to add state to functional components.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to extract component logic into reusable functions.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useWindowSize() {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({
    width: undefined,
    height: undefined,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleResize() {
      setWindowSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      });
    }

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    handleResize();

    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return windowSize;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Only call hooks at the top level**
   - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
   - Always call hooks in the same order

2. **Only call hooks from React functions**
   - Call hooks from React function components
   - Call hooks from custom hooks

3. **Use multiple state variables**
   - Instead of one large state object, use multiple useState calls

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more intuitive way to work with React's features. They make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components and help you write cleaner, more maintainable code.

Start experimenting with hooks in your next React project, and you'll quickly see how they can improve your development experience!
